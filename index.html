            <p><span class="dropcap-I">I</span><span class="smallcaps"> have always been</span> an aficionado of Music History. From an early age, I have been curious about classical composers, their work and how music has transformed since the first years of Western Civilization.</p> 
            <p class="second">I remember clearly the times I would sneak into my aunt's personal library to read an old xerox of an antique Music History Dictionary. The pictures were so bad and the title of the songs mentioned by the author were no more than words for me, since I could not listen to the works mentioned in that book and connect them to a sound.</p>

            <p><span class="smallcaps">Upon remembering,</span> with delightful nostalgia, this period of my life, I decided to create <i>The History of Music Project</i>. Important facts, photos and digital media were compiled in this website in order to provide the user, in a didactic and inclusive way, a journey through the course of the History of Music in Western Civilization, from the Middle Ages to the present day.</p>
