            The oldest musical form known to us in the West was originated inside of the enourmous and majestic cathedrals of Europe.

            <p>Such musical form consisted of a single melody originally unaccompanied, freely sung with irregular rhythms that were generally guided by the accentuation of words and by the natural rhythm of the Latin language, which was the official language of the Catholic church.

            <p><span class="dropcap-W">W</span><span class="smallcaps">ith the construction</span> of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in 1163, Paris became an important musical hub.
            Between 1150 and 1250 a group of musicians active during this period became known as <i>"The Notre-Dame School."</i>
            <p>The composers of the Notre-Dame school are all anonymous except for two, <i>Léonin</i> and <i>Pérotin</i>, both of whom are mentioned in a 13th-century treatise by an anonymous English scholar studying in Paris.</p>
            <p>These two composers are very significant to the music history because they were the first composers to write a repertory of polyphonic music, called at the time <i>organum</i>, and have it to gain international prestige and circulation.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The details of Léonin’s life are not known. To him is attributed the <i>Magnus Liber Organi</i> or <i>“Great Book of Organum”</i> in English, a collection of two-voiced organum settings, notably of <i>Gradual, Alleluia,</i> and <i>Responsory</i> chants, for the complete liturgical year.<br>
            It is known that he was the first music director of Notre-Dame from its creation until 1180, when Pérotin took over his position.</p>

            <p>The identity of Perotinus is largely a matter of speculation. Circumstantial evidence points to his being at Notre-Dame at the end of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th.<br>
            <p class="second">In addition to revising Léonin's <i>Magnus Liber Organi</i>, Pérotin is known to have composed two extensive four-part works, <i>“Viderunt Omnes”</i> and <i>“Sederunt Omnes”</i> who are comparable in scope to cathedrals of Gothic architecture, such as Notre-Dame.</p>
