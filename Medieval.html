      <h2>Pre and Early Medieval</h2>
      <p>The official monophonic unison chant (originally unaccompanied) of the Christian liturgies.<br>
      The term, though general, is used to refer particularly to the chant repertories with Latin texts.</p>
      <p>With the construction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in 1163, Paris became an important musical hub.<br>
    Between 1150 and 1250 a group of musicians active during this period became known as "The Notre-Dame School."<br>
    The composers of the Notre-Dame school are all anonymous except for two, <i>Léonin</i> and <i>Pérotin</i>, both of whom are mentioned in a 13th-century treatise by an anonymous Englishman studying in Paris.<br>
    These two composers are very significant to the music history because they were the first composers to write a repertory of polyphonic music, called at the time <i>organum</i>, and have it to gain international prestige and circulation.
      <h3>Léonin (1135 - 1201)</h3>
      <p>The details of Léonin’s life are not known. To him is attributed the <i>Magnus Liber Organi</i> or <i>“Great Book of Organum”</i> in English, a collection of two-voiced organum settings, notably of <i>Gradual, Alleluia,</i> and <i>Responsory</i> chants, for the complete liturgical year.<br>
      It is known that he was the first music director of Notre-Dame from its creation until 1180, when Pérotin took over his position.</p>

      <h3>Pérotin (1160 - 1236)</h3>
      <p>The identity of Perotinus is largely a matter of speculation. Circumstantial evidence points to his being at Notre-Dame at the end of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th.<br>
        In addition to revising Léonin's <i>Magnus Liber Organi</i>, Pérotin is known to have composed two extensive four-part works, <i>“Viderunt Omnes”</i> and <i>“Sederunt Omnes”</i> who are comparable in scope to cathedrals of Gothic architecture, such as Notre-Dame.</p>
